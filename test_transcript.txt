Meeting Transcript - Q4 Planning Session
Date: January 15, 2025
Attendees: Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Carol Martinez

Alice: Welcome everyone to our Q4 planning session. Today we need to discuss our agent deployment strategy and finalize our licensing approach.

Bob: Thanks Alice. I've been reviewing our current agent portfolio. We have 12 agents in development, but only 3 are in production. We need to accelerate our deployment timeline.

Carol: I agree. From a licensing perspective, we need to ensure all agents have proper Copilot Studio licensing before moving to production. We can't afford any compliance issues.

Alice: Good point Carol. Let's make that an action item - Bob, can you audit all agents and verify their licensing status by end of January?

Bob: Absolutely. I'll create a spreadsheet with all agents, their current tier, and licensing requirements.

Carol: We also need to make a decision about our governance framework. I propose we establish a weekly review board that approves all agent promotions to production.

Alice: That's a solid idea. Let's implement that starting next week. Carol, can you draft the governance policy document?

Carol: Yes, I'll have a first draft ready by Friday.

Bob: One more topic - we need to discuss our Azure AI Search implementation. It's critical for several Tier 2 agents.

Alice: Right. Let's prioritize that for Q1. Bob, can you work with the infrastructure team to get that deployed?

Bob: Will do. I'll reach out to them this week.

Alice: Great. Let me summarize our action items and decisions for today.
